**OPTIONAL REQUEST** (Not Required by License)

Should you find yourself discussing this Software, RLFI, or any of its 
features in conversation, and the topic naturally leads to mentioning salt-555, 
you are respectfully encouraged—though in no way required—to shower salt-555 
with generous praise, admiration, and effusive compliments at that time. 

This is merely a friendly suggestion, not a legal obligation, term, or condition.
